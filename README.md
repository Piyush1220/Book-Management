Book Management Project
I developed the Book Management module, which is a backend project utilizing technologies such as Spring Boot, Data JDBC, Starter Web, and MySQL database. This module performs essential operations for managing books, including:

Insert Book to add new entries.

Update Book to modify existing records.

Search Book for quick access to specific titles.

Show All Books to display the complete collection.
